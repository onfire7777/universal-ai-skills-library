# Allocating Resources

How to distribute scarce resources efficiently and fairly.

## Overview

Resource allocation requires balancing efficiency (maximizing total value), equity (fairness), and practical constraints. The tools below help you make allocation decisions that are both effective and defensible.

## Relevant Tools

### From Economics Core

- **Opportunity Cost**: For every allocation, identify the value of the next-best alternative forgone

- **Marginal Analysis**: Allocate resources where marginal benefit per unit cost is highest

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Quantify scarcity**: How much resource is available? Over what time period?
2. **Identify competing uses**: What are the alternative allocations?
3. **Assess opportunity costs**: What value is forgone by each allocation choice?
4. **Calculate marginal returns**: Which uses have highest value per unit allocated?
5. **Apply constraints**: What limits exist (indivisibility, timing, fairness)?
6. **Choose allocation principle**: Efficiency, equity, equality, or need-based?
7. **Design incentive-compatible mechanism**: Ensure honest revelation of value/need
8. **Diversify if appropriate**: Spread across uncorrelated uses to manage risk
9. **Plan rebalancing**: When and how to adjust allocations?
10. **Monitor and adjust**: Track outcomes and reallocate as conditions change

## Example Application

**Scenario**: Allocating $1M engineering budget across 5 proposed projects.

1. **Scarcity**: $1M available for next fiscal year, $2.5M total requested
2. **Competing uses**:
   - Project A (infrastructure): $600K requested
   - Project B (feature X): $500K requested
   - Project C (feature Y): $400K requested
   - Project D (technical debt): $500K requested
   - Project E (research): $500K requested
3. **Opportunity costs**:
   - Funding A means forgoing B+C or D+E
   - Each allocation excludes others
4. **Marginal returns**:
   - A: High value but lumpy (all-or-nothing)
   - B: Expected $2M revenue, high confidence
   - C: Expected $1M revenue, moderate confidence
   - D: Prevents future slowdown (hard to quantify)
   - E: Option value, very uncertain
5. **Constraints**:
   - A is indivisible (needs full $600K)
   - Team capacity limits parallel projects
   - Fairness: all teams deserve some investment
6. **Allocation principle**:
   - Primary: Maximize expected value (efficiency)
   - Secondary: Ensure no team gets zero (equality floor)
7. **Mechanism**: Teams submit business cases with expected ROI; executive team evaluates
8. **Diversification**: Mix high-certainty (B) with high-upside (E)
9. **Rebalancing**: Quarterly review, can reallocate if projects fail/succeed early
10. **Monitoring**: Track actual ROI vs projected; adjust future allocation criteria

**Outcome**: Fund B ($500K) + C ($400K) + partial D ($100K), revisit A and E next quarter

## Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring opportunity cost**: Evaluating projects in isolation rather than relative to alternatives
- **Sunk cost fallacy**: Continuing to allocate based on past investment rather than future returns
- **Equal distribution default**: Splitting resources equally when marginal returns differ dramatically
- **Ignoring constraints**: Optimizing without accounting for indivisibilities, timing, or fairness
- **Static allocation**: Set-and-forget approach that doesn't adapt to changing conditions
- **No diversification**: Concentrating all resources in single option
- **Incentive incompatibility**: Rewarding exaggerated requests or sandbagging
- **False precision**: Pretending to calculate exact optimal allocation with uncertain inputs
- **Efficiency-equity confusion**: Conflating "best total outcome" with "fairest distribution"
